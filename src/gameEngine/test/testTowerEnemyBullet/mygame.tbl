// Fields are separated by one or more tabs.
// Lines without tabs (such as these) are ignored, and can be used as comments.
// Some fields (names, filenames) may contain spaces.

// Define the splash image.  It will appear on the intro screen as soon as it
// is loaded.  Therefore we should define it at the beginning of the
// initialisation.
// Note the "-", 0, and "-" field.  For an image:
// * the second field is the tile name by which it is known (we
//   use "-" here to indicate "don't care".  
// * the third field is the tile cid of the tile (we just fill in 0)
// * the fifth field is the graphical operation to perform on the loaded image
//   file ("-" means none).  Available operations are flip ("x", "y") and
//   rotate ("r" - right, "l" - left, "u" - 180 degrees).
