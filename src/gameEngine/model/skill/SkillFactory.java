 * Facilitate the user to create skills. Here I use the most simple way to do factory.
 * It has lots of drawback to use string to do factory but in this case it is fine
 * because the creation itself is simple(just one line). Also, we don't have many skills at all.
 *  Factory Method or Abstract Factory should be an overkill.
