Contains controllers that allow tabs in the game authoring environment to communicate with GameData. All controllers implement Java's Observer/Observable interface with their respective tabs being the Observable and the controllers themselves being the Observers. When all fields in a tab are complete and submission of information is attempt, the controllers receive an update such that they can then write to GameData. The use of the Observer/Observable interface allows GameData (the model) to be detached from each view component.
