Contains all GUI-related components for the game authoring environment. The main class is GameAuthoringGUI, which can be run to create and output a game. The primary components of GameAuthoringGUI are the tab classes: BasicInfoTab, EnemyDesignTab, MapDesignTab, SkillsDesignTab, TempBarrierDesignTab, TowerDesignTab, and WaveDesignTab. Two classes also allow for the existence of a user resource library within the authoring environment, UserImagesTab and UserSoundsTab. When using the GameAuthoringGUI, mousing over fields will display "tips" that help to complete the fields. The user can also save out and load a premade game through the menu bar. In general, all resources can be clicked and dragged from the library onto appropriate fields. The user can also choose to display DuvallClippy, who provides a brief overview of the currently active design tab.
