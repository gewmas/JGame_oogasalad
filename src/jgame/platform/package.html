Contains the platform-dependent JGame classes.


<P>
The packages jgame and jgame.platform contain all the classes you need to
import to write your own game.

<P>

The main classes are jgame.platform.JGEngine (the whole game) and
jgame.JGObject (a game object).  Sublass these to write your own game.  It's
handy to have your JGObject classes as inner classes of your JGengine.
jgame.JGTimer is used for creating timers in your games.  JGImage is an
interface defining the cross-platform image methods that are used by JGame but
can be used stand-alone as well.  

<P>

StdGame is a game framework that handles a standard game state machine
(startlevel, life lost, game over, etc).  It is built as a layer on top of
JGEngine.  

<P>

AppConfig (JRE only) is a stand-alone class that can be used for game
configuration.  It is used by the JRE version of StdGame for handling keyboard
settings.  Highscores is a helper class that can be used to implement
highscores.   It is also used by the JRE version of StdGame.

<P>

JGame should also come with a user manual (the file MANUAL).  It is
distributed under the revised BSD license (see the file LICENSE).

These packages have been editing by team FooBar as a part of the OOGASalad project 
for Duke University's Compsci 308 course. We have added in new states to StdGame 
to indicate when the user has won the game, as compared to losing. In addition, 
we have added functionality to resize images, and change image transparency. We 
have also modified the use of image URLs so that all URLs are relative to the src 
folder of the package, and added methods to change the names of the game as well 
as game score and lives.
